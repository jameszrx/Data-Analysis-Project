For problem 1:
Run PJ5_1.py. You can first do the statistics part and then plot part. 



For problem 2:
Run PJ5_1.py. 



For problem 3:
Run PJ5_3.py. First you should run with the whole tag list. Then by seeing the summary report of each 
hashtag, find the top 3 features of each hashtag. Next, change some pieces of code to do the scatter plot for three

plot part to plot different feature;
3) change name of x_label of different feature.



For problem 4:
You should put the related data folders and train_featuregeneration.py in the same directory with the 
script. Run PJ5_4.py.



For problem 5:
You should put the related data folders and test_featuregeneration.py in the same 
directory with the script. Run PJ5_5.py.



For problem 6:
You should put the related data folders in the same directory with our programs. Run PJ5_6.py.



To solve problem 7, open the source code Project5_7_1.py and Project5_7_2.py, change the directory of the data file 
to the correct directory in your computer and run it.
