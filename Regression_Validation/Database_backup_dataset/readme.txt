1. In network_backup folder, there’s a folder called code, which contains all codes for dealing with Network backup dataset. To run them correctly, you need to change the loading file address. The name of each .py file contains a number which represents the problem number in spec. To be specific:
Network-1-plot: plot the given dataset to find the pattern;
Network-2-a: linear regression model;
Network-2-b: random forest model;
Network-2-c: neural network model;
Network-3-piecewise: piece-wise linear regression model;
Network-3-polynomial: polynomial regression model.

2. In Boston_housing folder, there’s also a folder called code, which contains all codes for dealing with Boston housing dataset. To run them correctly, you also need to change the loading file address. The name of each .py file contains a number which represents the problem number in spec. To be specific:
4-1 Housing: linear regression model;
4-2 Housing: polynomial regression model;
5-1 Housing: ridge regression model, you should change the alpha value from 1 to 0.001. If you want to make it clear, remember to change the alpha value in the output title;
5-2 Housing: lasso regression model, you should change the alpha value from 1 to 0.001. If you want to make it clear, remember to change the alpha value in the output title.
