for problem1
run file Prj_pb1.m and wnmfrule.m

for problem2
run file Prj3_pb2.m and wnmfrule.m
change the line 34 in Prj3_pb2.m for different k

for problem 3
run Prj3_pb3.m and wnmfrule.m

for problem 4
to calculate the total squared error, run Prj3_pb4_1.m and wnmfrule1.m
also change line 71 in wnmfrule1.m for different lambda

to draw  the ROC curve, run Prj3_pb4_2.m and wnmfrule1.m
also change line 71 in wnmfrule1.m and line 21 in Prj3_pb4_2.m for different lambda and k

for problem 5
to calculate the precision, run Prj3_pb5_1.m and wnmfrule1.m
to calculate the hit rate and false-alarm rate, run Prj3_pb5_2.m and wnmfrule1.m
